# Experiment assignment 1

In the experiment we deployed a small java application to Heroku.\
Links to heroku are posted at the bottom of the report.

### Technical problems that occured and how to solve them

During the installation of the software development environment i did not encounter any technical problems, 
the reason for that is that i already had it all set up from last year where we had a project were we used maven/springboot together with heroku for a CI/CD pipeline.

### How to validate the software development environment is working
I have checked that the environment worked by checking all versions of the software i used to be up to date and seamingless pushing it to git and deploying to heroku without any issues.

### Technical problems encountered with Heroku and solution
I only encountered with Heroku since i am on a free option, so i already 5 projects and had to delete some of them to be able to add new ones without paying.\
I also had to skip the add-on part since i didn't want to put my credit card in to do that step.

### Results
So the results from the experiment was that i got to do everything in the experiment without any issues (if you dont count deleting already existing heroku deployments).
